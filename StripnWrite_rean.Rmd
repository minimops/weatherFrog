```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The following saves "cli_data.rds" as a dt. full reanalysis dataset with split date and time
```{r read and full save - this has to be run regardless}
###caution!
#this does take quite a while
#for some reason format is quite inefficient
require(data.table)

#import and convert to data.table
cli_data <- as.data.table(readRDS("Data/data_reanalysis_20201109.rds"))

#splitting Date and Time (takes a while)
cli_data[, date := as.Date(cli_data$time, tz = "CET")]
cli_data[, time := as.numeric(format(cli_data$time,"%H"))]

#saving dataset with split Date and time
saveRDS(cli_data, "Data/cli_data.rds")
```


```{r }


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
